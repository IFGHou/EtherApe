User visible features:
----------------------

  * change user and drop privileges. Perhaps use also capabilities.

  * identify nodes from protocol window. It could be done by maintaining a
    node tree for every global protocol.

  * show all node stats in node window

  * find a way to record both ports of a link/connection

  * revise preferences dialog; allow filtering out netbios names

  * Ability to set per node preferences. Like setting an hour long
    averaging time only for the router.

  * Ability to manually place nodes. It's dependent on the above.
    Once is done you will be able to open and save your own 
    diagrams.

  * Make OSI level decoding consistent even with encapsulation. Multiple
    protocols should be shown comma separated at the proper level, instead of
    being incorrectly bumped up. Example: "ETHII, LLC-SNAP -> IP", instead of
    "ETHII -> LLC-SNAP -> IP".

Issues in the source code
-------------------------

  * rewrite names handling. Do only packet extraction at capture time, name
    resolution at display time and only for the chosen address.

  * use glib datastructs everywhere, instead of a mix of glib and in-house.

  * refactor stop handling; separate clearing data from updating. 

  * Why am I using a global "interface" and a second "device"
    in capture.c? Check that I can just use interface.

  * Use a GArray instead of a fixed array for the protocols
    stack.
