Description: graphical network monitor
 EtherApe is a graphical network monitor modeled after etherman. it displays
 network activity graphically, showing active hosts as circles of varying
 size, and traffic among them as lines of varying width.
 .
 It features link layer, ip and TCP modes, color-color coded protocols
 display, Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ISDN, PPP and SLIP devices. It can
 filter traffic to be shown, and can read traffic from a file as well as
 live from the network.
