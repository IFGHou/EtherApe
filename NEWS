                            Changelog for EtherApe

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.13 (Sun May 05, 2013):
   Central node option, useful for displaying routers or proxies.
   Translations and documentation updates, plus some fixes.

   Changes summary:
     * Optional central node, based on work of Javier Fernandez-Sanguino 
       Peña.
     * re-enabled full-screen mode, thanks to nrvale0
     * Updated spanish translation, thanks to Javier Fernandez-Sanguino 
       Peña.
     * Added German translation, and fixed typos, thanks to Chris Leick.
     * Updated documentation.


  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.12 (Tuesday May 31, 2011):
   This is a bug fix release.
   David Goldfarb discovered a critical bug in EtherApe, causing a 
   NULL pointer indirection with RPC traffic.
   This bug has security implications, because can be exploited to a 
   (remote) DOS attack.
   Packet content is not involved, however, so no privilege escalation 
   should happen (unless the machine is already subverted by other means). 

   Changes summary:
     * fix bug 3309061 (CVE-2011-3369)


  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.11 (Friday May 27, 2011):
   Several users asked for a way to export traffic statistics.
   EtherApe now can save a snapshot with all known nodes and relevant
   informations to an XML file. With option --final-export, a dump is
   automatically generated when a capture file is fully replayed.
   Additionally, option --signal-export enables SIGUSR1 handling, to 
   dump on signal.

   EtherApe used to have two links for connection, one for each traffic
   direction. With this release, only one link is needed, gaining more
   complete statistics and better resource usage.

   EtherApe config file is now ~/.config/etherape, instead of the older,
   deprecated, ~/.gnome2/Etherape. Migration is automatic.
   Filter expression is now saved.

   Thanks to OpenSUSE Build Service and a new spec file, development rpms can
   easily be built for OpenSUSE 11.3, SLE11, Centos5/RHEL5, Fedora and
   Mandriva.
   The spec file is somewhat generic, lacking the nicer integrations of
   official distribution packages, so you are advised to build with EtherApe 
   spec file only as a last resort.

   OSX compatibility improved, thanks to Zack Perry.

   The old, deprecated, direct resolver was removed. Name resolution is now
   only done with the full fledged threaded resolver.

   Changes summary:
     * XML export of node statistics.
     * added --final-export to export statistics at replay end.
     * added --signal-export to export statistics on SIGUSR1 (FR 3185920).
     * improved link statistics
     * added a toolbar button to open the nodes window.
     * a new button allows skipping lengthy pauses when replaying.
     * fixed a long-standing bug affecting expiry timeouts. EtherApe was
       overestimating traffic averages.
     * used stock icons when possible to improve consistency with themes.
     * EtherApe now builds natively on CENTOS5/RHEL5. 
     * rewrote spec file for use with OpenSUSE Build Service.
     * updated documentation.
     * removed several (harmless) compiler warnings to make packager's life 
       easier.
     * imported debian-specific patches and a swedish translation by Daniel
       Nylander.
     * workaround for OSX troubles with gtk_input_add. Thanks to Zack Perry 
       persistence for helping diagnose and fix.
     * removed obsolete preference "cycle assigned colors".
     * removed deprecated direct resolver
     * config file now saved to ~/.config/etherape
     * filter expression is now saved with the other preferences.
     * italian translation
     * link and node sizes now computed with the same variable types.
     * new size variables: active packets, total packets, average packet size.


  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.10 (Sunday Feb 06, 2011):
   The most notable change is IPV6 support, thanks to David Flamand.
   EtherApe now computes average packet size, to better estimate network
   usage.
   The new option --min-delay allows slow-motion replay of a capture file.

   In 0.9.9 relnotes I forgot to mention a fix from Sotiris Sotiropoulos.
   Many apologies for the mistake.
   
   Note: the old non-threaded name resolver is deprecated and will be
   removed on the next release. If you really need it, speak up *now*.
   Works only with IPV4 addresses, anyway.

   Changes summary:
     * IPV6 support, thanks to David Flamand.
     * new statistic: average packet size.
     * added option --min-delay, to complement --max-delay when
       replaying from file. With this option you can replay a capture
       in slow-motion.
     * tweaked default service file, adding some common ports.
     * added check for invalid proto-color mappings (debian bug 566226).
     * removed bogus double assignement. Thanks to "johndoe123321".

   Important: CVS repository shutdown
     Effective from today, EtherApe CVS is no longer accessible.
     Plese refer to the Mercurial repository.


  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.9 (Monday Jan 04, 2010):
   The most interesting change of this release is *basic* 802.11 WLAN support.
   WLAN is one of the most complex protocols around ('crazy' sometimes seems a 
   better description) and there's no way to support it completely without a 
   dedicated display mode.
   As an example, a single WLAN packet could contain up to four (4) addresses,
   source and destination, plus AP interchange. Showing the exact packet route
   could be interesting for someone trying to understand WLANs, but not very
   useful to monitor application traffic.
   So EtherApe tries to treat APs like routers, ignoring them if not directly
   addressed.  Thus a packet starting from node X and ending with node Y will be 
   shown as a straight link between the two nodes, even if the real path was 
   X-AP and AP-Y.

   The other notable improvement is 802.1Q VLAN tagging support.  VLAN tags are
   decoded but ignored, showing all traffic as being in a normal LAN.
   Filtering a single vlan could be accomplished with pcap expressions.
   Note:
   Due to pcap limitations, to correctly filter VLAN traffic the pcap filter 
   must start with the keyword "vlan" (e.g.  vlan and ip) and *all* traffic must
   be VLAN-tagged.

   Note to packagers: EtherApe now uses gnome-doc-utils. Manual should
   appear in yelp under 'Internet'.

   Important: this release will be the last mirrored on the CVS repository, wich
   will be shut down as of march 2010.

   Changes summary:
     * wlan and wlan/radiotap protocol decoding.
     * wlan QOS support.
     * PPI (Per Packet Incapsulation) decoding.
     * basic 802.1Q VLAN support (FRQ: 1561647).
     * LLC-SNAP support.
     * unified link level modes.
     * several performance enhancements.
     * refactored and streamlined node id definition.
     * improved l3 packet deconding, now fully dynamic.
     * improved documentation, now using gnome-doc-utils.
     * borrowed some info from Mandriva .desktop file.
     * Mandriva now compiles with -Werror=format-security and EtherApe was
       failing to compile.  Thanks to Jerome Brenier for the fix.


  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.8 (Sunday Sep 27 2009):

   Apart for the usual bug fixes, this release see a the switch to glade-3, the
   overdue removal of bonobo dock and several other deprecated widgets. 
   Most of the ui now uses directly Gtk+ instead of Gnome. At this time
   there isn't a real alternative to GnomeCanvas, so quite a bit of Gnome 
   still remains.
   To make partially up for the long delay, there are some new functionality as
   well: a node listing window, substantial performance enhancements, and some 
   improvements here and there. See the details below.
   Note the new timing defaults: out of the box, Etherape will react faster to 
   traffic changes and give a better "feel" of current the network state.
   The faster expiration will also help to reduce memory and cpu requirements.
   On the other hand, "forgetting" inactive nodes faster makes Etherape less 
   suited for mid-term monitoring; the new values will be too small.
   I believe this change will be useful to most people, though, and especially
   suited to newcomers, who often have difficulties understanding the different 
   timing types. Experienced users can still easily adapt Etherape to their 
   needs.
   I have already mentioned the switch to mercurial. A couple months from now 
   the CVS repository will be shut down.

   Changes summary:
     * Fixed bug 1713590, bad replaying of out-of-order packets (Bug report 
       by "haywire_dk")
     * Fixed bug 1435271, about box doesn't report version (Bug report
       by Cullen Newsom, who had to wait more than three years for this
       fix). 
     * Fixed bug 2839050, a massive memory leak reported by "psistormyamato".
     * Fixed a bug causing no-data tcp packets to have incorrect port.
     * Improved performance in several key areas.
     * Upgraded to glade-3, removed deprecated widgets and functions, tweaked
       the looks a bit.
     * Added --glade-file option to load a different glade file.
     * Renamed --infile to --replay-file to be more consistent with the 
       shortcut (-r).
     * Option --zero-delay (-z) is now replaced by --max-delay, receiving a
       maximum delay in ms between packet when replaying from file.
     * Revised preferences dialog. Timeouts now expressed in seconds.
     * Added preference for diagram text color.
     * Added port column to protocol infos (Feature request 2818525).
     * Made node name and ip selectable in node/link info (FR 2818525 again).
     * Preferences dialog now accepts multiple protocols for a color.
     * Added a node window, showing a table with all non-expired nodes (i.e.
       both those visible on diagram and the inactive, hidden, but not removed
       ones).
     * Removed several outdated preferences: diagram is always anti-aliased,
       links always fade on timeout and info windows show protocol data.
     * Revised default timings, now geared toward instant monitoring. 
       Previous values where more suited for mid-term analisys.
       Since sub-second timeouts aren't very useful, and reading milliseconds
       less than ideal, all expire periods now are entered in seconds.
     * Etherape had always the ability to map multiple protocols to a single 
       color, but you had to create multiple rows, manually matching the RGB
       code. Now the preferences dialog accepts protocols separated by ',' for 
       the same row and also compacts automatically previously distinct rows. 
       You can also change the row color.
     * The link width slider now controls the link width/node radius ratio, so
       changing both node and link size will be easier, while retaining the
       ability to have a links smaller or greater than nodes.
     * Expanded internal consistency checks.
     * Info and debug levels are now enabled by defining the environment 
       variable APE_DEBUG with values respectively info or debug (case 
       insensitive).
 

  Development repository switched to Mercurial (Tuesday Sep 08 2009):

   Now that SourceForge officially supports Mercurial, there's no reason 
   to still use CVS.
   DVCs are faster, have much more features and imho much better suited 
   to open source work.
   Using hg should also lower the barrier for anyone wishing to hack on
   Etherape.
   The old CVS repo will be occasionally (e.g. on releases) synchronized
   for a while to make life easier for packagers. Full history will be 
   available only on hg, however.
   Note:
   The new mercurial repo contains almost all the past project history, 
   but since it's a conversion between two very different systems (for 
   example, CVS doesn't have changesets, so the converter must infer them
   from timestamps and commit messages), there are some differences. 
   So, if you really want to know how the project evolved before release 
   0.9.7, please consult the CVS repo.  


  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.7 (Saturday Sep 30 2006):

   Bugfix  release. Special thanks to Pav Lucistnik for providing patches
   and bug reports.

   Changes summary:
     * Fixed  bug  1496607, thread termination failure (Bug report by Pav
       Lucistnik).
     * Fixed bug 1496621, crash after pausing (Fix by Pav Lucistnik).
     * Fixed  bug  1496614,  crash  in  initialize_ethers()  (Fix  by Pav
       Lucistnik).

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.6 (Tuesday May 16 2006):

   Some  distributions  had  trouble  linking  correctly  EtherApe.  This
   release should fix that.

   Changes summary:
     * On  newer  distros  (like  FC5)  the  linker  was  called  without
       --export-dynamic, making EtherApe unusable.
     * Fixed  bug  1488215, "cancel" button on preferences dialog doesn't
       work.
     * Updated .desktop and .spec files
     * Updated debian files. Thanks to F.Peters (debian maintainer).

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.5 (Saturday May 06 2006):

   After the recent changes the manual was really obsolete.  This release
   features  a  completely  rewritten  one,  properly integrated with the
   Gnome  help  browser. You'll find EtherApe under Applications - System
   tools.

   Changes summary:
     * Manual  completely  rewritten with docbook-XML. Now registers with
       scrollkeeper.
     * Thanks  to  Jeffrey  G.  Gomberg, who had the patience to test and
       identify problems, this release features improved OSX support.
     * Thanks to Ben Allen, added a new opzion, 'zero-delay' (-z) to play
       captured files without accounting for timestamp.  Usually EtherApe
       uses  the  timestamp  to  playback  packets  as  they came in when
       recording. This option essentially disables this, making as if all
       packets came in at once.
       As Ben said 'It provides a QUICK way to generate a graph of all of
       the  conversations  in  a capture file, without having to wait the
       length  of  the capture. This is helpful for visualizing data from
       long (hours to days) captures'.
     * Fixed a bug preventing conversations to expire properly.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.4 (Saturday Jan 14 2006):

   This  release  comes  after  a  first  round of extensive refactoring,
   needed  to clean up some of the cruft accumulated during the years and
   make  further  developments  easier.  While  still a work in progress,
   memory control is tighter and protocol dissectors more robust.

   EtherApe  calculates  an  extensive set of traffic statistics, even if
   only a small part is always visible on the diagram. For example, every
   node  and  link  maintains  complete data for every protocol seen, but
   only  the  most active one is displayed.  Thus, the detail dialogs now
   show also traffic breakdown by protocol.

   Changes summary:
     * New  feature:  link  info  dialog. Double-clicking on a link shows
       traffic and protocol statistics.
     * New  feature:  improved node info dialog now displays both traffic
       and protocol statistics.
     * New  feature: protocol aging. Now protocols, like nodes and links,
       can expire and be purged automatically.
     * Heavy  refactoring  to  make  sources  easier  to  understand  and
       maintain.
     * Small performance enhancements due to refactoring.
     * Better memory handling due to refactoring.
     * Unified handling of traffic statistics.
     * Rewritten interface listing. Now uses directly pcap_findalldevs to
       list interfaces available for capturing. The interface submenu now
       list  also  the  "any"  device,  if  present.  The older method is
       deprecated  (at  the  moment it can be enabled with a #define) and
       will  be  removed in a future release. If someone needs it, please
       file a feature request.
     * Tidied up preferences dialog, removing unneeded entries.
     * Rewritten and improved node/link timeout handling.
     * Fixes  bug  1362426  (i8n  issues).  Thanks to Daniel Nylander for
       hunting down that and providing a detailed example.
     * Fixes bug 1385105 (crash with double free). Thanks to goga_russian
       for the segnalation.
     * Fixes  bug  1372245  (crashes  when  node goes too big). Thanks to
       goga_russing for the segnalation.
     * Fixes bug 1396236 ("force numeric" and "dns resolution" checkboxes
       not working).
     * Fixes  bug  1268291 (OSX net/if.h). Thanks to Eric Stewart for the
       patch.
     * Legend labels now align to left.
     * Fixed a bug when closing the preferences dialog.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.3 (Thursday 8-18-2005):

     * Fixes bug 1083524 (deletion of all user colors)
     * Fixes bug 1024944 (compilation on OSX).  Thanks to Lars Eggert for
       the patch.
     * Fixes  a bug with the legend handling (beware: on later gnomes the
       legend  could  behave  strangely if you use a binary package built
       for an older gnome release)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.2 (Saturday 8-13-2005):

     * New multithreaded name resolution using the standard resolver api.
       Works with dns, /etc/host, ...
       Note:  The multithreaded resolver needs gethostbyaddr_r(). If your
       distribution  doesn't  have  it,  you're  forced  to  use  the old
       resolver.
     * Small fixes for gcc 4
     * cvs cleanup

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.1 (Wednesday 8-11-2004):

     * Color-coded protocol dialog
     * Some tweaks to compile with newer distros

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.9.0(Saturday 01-03-2003):

     * Gnome  2  preliminary  support,  including  a  new  option  for an
       antialiased diagram.
     * Gcc 3.2 compile support
     * Some bug and potential bug fixes
     * New Turkish translation, by Gôrkem Cetin
     * Several fixes to assure proper compilation with newer autotools
     * Resolved memory bug by limiting resolved names to 1024 entries and
       arranging them in a simple LRU cache

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.8.2 (Sunday 08-12-2001):

     * Fix  from  Dave  Yearke to bring back compilability to systems not
       defining DLT_LINUX_SLL
     * Should fix node globbing on screen under heavy loads
     * Added  dialogs  for name selection. The code behind the dialogs is
       not there yet, so don't expect it to work

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.8.1 (Monday 08-06-2001):

     * Added  support  for  ISDN on Linux (added support for linux cooked
       sockets  in general). Thanks to Ole Andreas Weel for providing the
       capture file.
     * Removes  some  testing  info that was showing up when adding a new
       color to the color-protocols table

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.8.0 (Friday 08-03-2001):

     * Added  much requested color selection dialog, to set and save your
       preferences for protocol coloring
     * Fixes program not behaving when using pause in live capture
     * Fixes  a  potential  crash when deleting the font selection window
       using the window manager

  Juan Toledo got his engineering [1]degree (07-20-2001)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.7.8 (Friday 07-06-2001):

     * Fixes device being left in promiscuous mode at exit

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.7.7 (Friday 06-22-2001):

     * Per  mode  name  selection  code  was  not  working. For instance,
       /etc/ethers was not being used in ethernet mode. Fixed
     * Fixes a crash triggered at times when changing modes or restarting
       a capture
     * Should fix a cluttering of the display under heavy loads
     * Removes a compilation warning about floor not being declared

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.7.6 (Sunday 05-13-2001):

     * Now  you can decide if you want to group unknown TCP and udp ports
       or not
     * Can show IPX SAP resource names in ethernet mode
     * Added  a  good  deal of new protocols: ICQ, napster, DEC, LAT, IPX
       and  many,  many more. Remember that you must set Ethernet mode in
       order to see non IP protocols
     * You can select the columns to display in the protocols window
     * Pausing a live capture doesn't drop packets (statistics will still
       be valid)
     * Fixes mode setting from the command line

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.7.5 (Friday 05-10-2001):

     * Added  more  information  to  the  protocols  window: instantenous
       traffic, last heard and number of packets
     * Greatly  improves  CPU  usage,  should  drop less packets in heavy
       loaded   networks   (increase  refresh  period  if  you  are  more
       interested in truthful statistics)
     * Double  click  a  protocol  in  the  protocols  window  to  get an
       individual  window  for  that protocol (yet to be filled with more
       data)
     * Fixes a segfault introduced in 0.7.4 triggered under heavy loads

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.7.4 (Wednesday 05-09-2001):

     * Added  support  for  RPC_REPLYs  and  passive  FTP. That's because
       EtherApe now understands the notion of conversations
     * Application is more responsive now under heavy loads
     * Fixed  the CPU problem and part of the leak that was introduced in
       0.7.1
     * Fixed CPU hogging when in pause
     * Fixed  a segfault triggered when a capture file was given first in
       the command line and later through the GUI

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.7.3 (Tuesday 05-08-2001):

     * Added  ability  to  resize  columns and sort rows in the protocols
       window table
     * Added  a  toolbar  button  and  a menu entry to call the protocols
       window
     * Unregistered  TCP  and  udp  ports now show as an unique protocol,
       instead of being summed up in TCP_UNKNOWN and UDP_UNKNOWN

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.7.2 (Monday 05-07-2001):

     * Displays  a  protocol  statistics window when you double click the
       protocols legend
     * Fixes  the  problem  with links not disappearing when stopping the
       capture

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.7.1 (Sunday 05-06-2001):

     * The  protocol  table  is emptied after stopping a capture, and now
       only  shows  the  relevant protocols when changing the stack level
       setting
     * Better  color  behavior: removed repeated colors, and cycles color
       usage for further protocols
     * Fixes  token ring mode in token ring networks (IP mode was working
       already)
     * Fixes a problem that showed up after a second offline capture in a
       row

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.7.0 (Saturday 05-05-2001):

     * New  node  cache  timeout  adjustment  to avoid building on memory
       usage
     * Some improvements to reduce CPU usage as time passes by
     * Updated Dutch and Spanish translations

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.9 (Thursday 04-26-2001):

     * Added  new  node  info  window  that pops up when a node is double
       clicked and is updated in real time. Since we have a proper window
       now, we can remove the hideous node pop up window
     * Fixes  nodes  reappearing  in  the diagram after a while and never
       being timed out again
     * Fixes  the  "** WARNING **: could not find signal handler" bug for
       architectures  that  were  not  automatically exporting symbols by
       adding libtool support

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.8 (Wednesday 04-25-2001):

     * Added  support  for  Token  Ring  (Thanks  to Robert Frank for the
       capture file)
     * Squashed yet another memory leak. (I won't say it's the last, lest
       Jim Howards proves me wrong again :-) )
     * Fixed more problems with names in FDDI mode

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.7 (Monday 04-23-2001):

     * RPM package finally works for RedHat users
     * Choose  node size from among (total|inbound|outbound) instantenous
       or accumulated traffic
     * Tooltips show correct accumulated traffic value
     * Node names are not forgotten when they timeout
     * Removed interape binary and moved etherape to bin from sbin

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.6 (Saturday 04-21-2001):

     * Fixes a serious leak introduced in 0.6.1

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.5 (Saturday 04-21-2001):

     * Reports  less false positive by giving priority to registered port
       numbers (below 1024) and fixing a bug that was causing etherape to
       only acknowledge RCP_REPLY messages
     * Get  extensive  node  info  in  console by double clicking it (use
       export DEBUG=INFO)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.4 (Friday 04-20-2001):

     * Better  support  for  NetBIOS  over  IP name recognition (captures
       names  from  host  announcements  messages,  besides  the  already
       supported session_request)
     * Fixes the "Illegal" node name bug
     * Compile fixes for platforms breaking at the libpcap check

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.3 (Thursday 04-19-2001):

     * Can find windows names in netbios over TCP session packets
     * Fixed a couple of cases in which ethernet addresses were displayed
       instead of IP addresses
     * Should report less false positive protocol identifications

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.2 (Wednesday 04-18-2001):

     * New  interface setting menu: now you can set the device to capture
       from at run time
     * Added support for RPC protocols. That means that NFS shows as such
       most of the time at last
     * Fixed a bug introduced in 0.6.0 that froze EtherApe
     * Fixed  a  couple  of  references  to null pointers which I believe
       where the cause of most crashes

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.1 (Tuesday 04-17-2001):

     * New  mode setting menu: now you can choose among link layer, IP or
       TCP modes on the fly from whitin the GUI
     * The status bar now shows an actually informative message

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.0 (Saturday 04-15-2001):

     * Play, pause and stop buttons now work as expected
     * New open capture file menu item
     * Fixed filter history
     * Fixed ip addresses not showing in FDDI

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.9 (Thursday 04-12-2001):

     * Does not leak anymore. Formally tested! :-)
     * Online  documentation.  At least you get the menu entries. I still
       need to finish writing the docs :-)
     * Default  operation  mode  is  now  IP.  If  you want to go back to
       ethernet mode, use -m ethernet at the command line
     * Loopback device now supported (was needed to test non-leakage)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.8 (Thursday 04-05-2001):

     * Fixed  non-displaying  text  on  diagram. If you still see squares
       instead  of  text,  go  to preferences and choose a new font. Save
       your preferences.
     * Application icon now shows on the window manager and the about box
     * Rpm package does not require alsa anymore

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.7 (Tuesday 04-03-2001):

     * Dutch translation. (Thanks, Vincent)
     * Fixed compilation problem with resolver library and newer libc
     * Menu entries for Gnome and Debian systems
     * Included application icon. I can't track who sent me the couple of
       icons  I  have. If anybody knows who the author is, please tell me
       so that I can properly credit him
     * New version after eleven months! Development is retaken! :-)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.6 (Thursday 05-4-2000):

     * Fixed  a  stupid  but serious bug introduced in 0.5.3 which caused
       the  capture  to  stop for no good reason. This happened because I
       was  away  from home and I was developing using only capture files
       with no access to any live network. I'm sorry it took me this long
       to solve the problem... :-(

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.5 (Saturday 04-22-2000):

     * New  Stack  Level  setting: "Topmost Recognized Protocol". This is
       probably  what  you  want to have as default. If you have used any
       previous  version  of  EtherApe  and have saved your settings, you
       will probably want to change it.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.4 (Saturday 04-22-2000):

     * TCP  and  UDP  protocols  are  read  from  a  configuration  file:
       services.  I  could  use  some  help in trying to determine what's
       missing  and  what should not be in in the deafault services file.
       Unified diffs accepted. :-)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.3 (Friday 04-21-2000):

     * Added start and stop buttons. The toolbar is back, since it is now
       useful. :-)
     * General menu cleanup

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.2 (Thursday 04-20-2000):

     * Added  new  -l option. You can use it to limit the nodes displayed
       only  to the N most active. GUI configuration and more the ability
       to use more criteria will come next

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.1 (Wednesday 04-19-2000):

     * Fixed lots of memory leaks thanks to Owen Taylor and his fantastic
       memprof
     * Should not hog the CPU in offline mode anymore
     * Node size is zero again when the average traffic is zero
     * Got rid of the toolbar by default

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.0 (Saturday 04-15-2000):

     * Fixed PPP and SLIP modes not showing any protocols nor names
     * Moved code to libglade. This means:
          + You will need libglade to compile and run EtherApe
          + No more GTK warnings
          + The view menu is fixed. Check buttons work as expected
          + You  can  change the interface by editing EtherApe.glade with
            glade without having to recompile
          + All kinds of benefits for the developer. Now I can go back at
            dealing with the GUI
     * These   are   major  changes.  Please  report  any  problems  (see
       README.bugs)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.7 (Friday 04-14-2000):

     * Fixed  segfault when applying preferences changes and a filter had
       been set up in the command line
     * (Bill Barth) New, improved static mode
     * Debug  messages  depend on the DEBUG environment variable. You can
       set  it  to  DEBUG or INFO if you want to see them again. Added -q
       option too, to get rid of WARNINGS as well
     * Refresh  period  is  finally  working  the  intended way (I hope).
       Should free up CPU in many cases

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.6 (Monday 04-10-2000):

     * Ports were not appearing in TCP mode
     * Accumulated per name traffic was not properly updated

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.5 (Sunday 04-09-2000):

     * /etc/ethers is used again in Ethernet mode
     * FQDN is again only used in IP or TCP mode
     * Added  new  --stationary  option,  so  that people getting sick of
       following nodes around can have a rest. :-)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.4 (Sunday 04-09-2000):

     * Nodes  keep track of all names by which they are referenced. Right
       now only the most used one is displayed
     * This breaks /etc/ethers usage for IP nodes. You'll see your router
       change  names  a  lot in ethernet mode. :-) I'll try to solve this
       tonight.
     * I  changed  quite  a lot of things. Please test it and tell me any
       problems you find so that I can fix them

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.3 (Tuesday 04-04-2000):

     * Recognizes   IP  fragmentation.  Should  make  up  for  unexpected
       protocols in your network
     * Node colors are those of its most common protocol. This is a bonus
       on my way of handling several names per node.
     * Fixed  a  bug  by which actually the least common protocol had its
       color  shown.  Come on, guys... How come nobody reported this one?
       :-)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.2 (Tuesday 04-04-2000):

     * Initial FDDI support.
     * Uploaded working RPM (for version 0.4.1).

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.1 (Monday 04-03-2000):

     * Hiding legend works again (for me, at least).
     * Link directions were reversed in ethernet mode.
     * New webpage (mostly copied from ethereal's :-) )
     * First try at RPM distribution. Please report whether it works.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.0 (Wednesday 03-29-2000):

     * Node size is dependent on outbound traffic
     * You can distinguish both directions of a link.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.9 (Wednesday 03-29-2000):

     * You  may  safely turn down refresh period to minimum. If CPU can't
       handle it, it will just do a best effort.
     * Patch from Fabrice Bellet. Should fix more RedHat problems. Please
       report if it solves yours.
     * Some more segfault fixing.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.8 (Wednesday 03-29-2000):

     * Filter entry has history.
     * Prefs window is raised when called.
     * I think I fixed almost all memory leaks.
     * Some more segfaults fixed.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.7 (Friday 03-24-2000):

     * You can now "playback" tcpdump output files.
     * The legend now has a scrollbar if there are more protocols than it
       can hold.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.6 (Friday 03-24-2000):

     * Recognizes level 5 UDP protocols.
     * Default stack level is now 5
     * Can  anybody  please  send  me  the most complete /etc/services in
       Earth?  Mine  in debian is quite complete, but it's missing things
       like ICQ.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.5 (Thursday 03-23-2000):

     * Sorry. I forgot to include the new files in the distribution. :-(

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.4 (Thursday 03-23-2000):

     * Recognizes  level  5  TCP  protocols  (Set  stack  level to 5) UDP
       protocols  should  be done tomorrow morning. (Can somebody explain
       me   why   6000   is   not   a  recognized  protocol  in  standard
       /etc/services?)
     * Fixed a compilation problem for people with libbind.a installed.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.3 (Thursday 03-23-2000):

     * Fixes a serious and stupid segfault.
     * Recognizes level 4 IP protocols (set stack level to 4)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.2 (Wednesday 03-22-2000):

     * You  may choose what level of the protocol stack to look at. Now I
       should be able to add more protocol decoding easyly.
     * I think I have squashed the growing legend bug. Please report.
     * Diagram tries to use most of the window.
     * Got  away  with  some  other  memory leaks, though I probably just
       introduced some others.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.1 (Monday 03-20-2000):

     * Capture filter may be set in the preferences dialog in runtime
     * Warning!  The  above is just candy to have you all test some major
       code restructuring. Please report any problems.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.0 (Saturday 03-18-2000):

     * Preferences can be saved
     * The  status  bar shows the main protocol when over a link, and the
       node name when over a node.
     * EtherApe  turns  1  month  old!  Thanks  everybody  for using this
       software. :-)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.2.11 (Friday 03-17-2000):

     * Fixed a segfault in linuxppc
     * Fixed a minor bug in the protocols legend
     * Translations to French and Spanish

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.2.10 (Thursday 03-16-2000):

     * Fixed several memory leaks (it's still leaking, though :-( )
     * Added font picker to the diagram settings
     * Size mode menu is now working.
     * Should compile again in Solaris

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.2.9 (Thursday 03-16-2000):

     * Fix  for  bug  introduced  in  0.2.8.  Resetting  the refresh rate
       eventually broght a SIGSEGV.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.2.8 (Wednesday 03-15-2000):

     * GUI enhancements suggested by mdf to save screen real state.
          + Diagram settings is a dialog under the preferences menu
          + Legend becomes a dockable item
          + Toolbar, legend and appbar may be hidden using the view menu.
     * GUI  for  two  more  sizing algorithms: log and sqrt. I'm afraid I
       still  don't  know  how  to get the menu item from an option_menu,
       though. Patch, anyone? :-)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.2.7 (Monday 03-13-2000):

     * Node info is now a popup.
     * Popup window shows Name, IP address and MAC address again.
     * Name is only FQDN in ip and tcp modes (more readable)
     * Now links age the moment they are not used.
     * Added 802.2 and 802.3 to ethernet protocols.
     * Fix for sigsegv when small link timeouts.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.2.6 (Saturday 03-11-2000):

     * Ethernet  protocols  are  recognized  and  presented  in different
       colors.
     * Links  not  in use are slowly faded out (patch by Ted Wright). Use
       --no-fade to avoid it.
     * Finally found a way to set the diagram background to black.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.2.5 (Friday 03-10-2000):

     * Initial support for color coded protocols display
     * Click  on  a  link  and a get a debug message with the most common
       ethernet protocol

     * Added README.bugs with procedures for bug reporting.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.2.3 (Wednesday 03-08-2000):

     * Non  blocking  reverse  lookups.  I  brought  dns.c in from mtr to
       provide this functionality. This code is from Simon Kirby.
     * Removed now unnecessary -r option.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.2.2 (Tuesday 03-07-2000):

     * Added ppp and slip devices support.
     * Brought   back  IP  address  display  in  ethernet  mode  when  no
       /etc/ethers is available
     * Fixed  another bug with RedHat 6.1. (I really have to find time to
       talk to this guy)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.2.1 (Monday 03-06-2000):

     * Added tcp mode. Run with etherape -m tcp
     * Added  fix  from  Ted Wright to provide a more readable display in
       crowded diagrams. Run with -o. Very useful for tcp.
     * Cleaned  up  sources so that adding other modes should be trivial.
       Please have a look at the source.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.2.0 (Friday 03-03-2000):

     * RedHat 6.1 fix. Works around "featureful" redhat 6.1 libpcap.
     * Fixed node-in-the-center bug.
     * Timeout=0 means never timeout.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.9 (Thursday 03-02-2000):

     * Finally I'm properly calculating average traffic. (yeah, right :-)
     * Node and link timeout work as expected as well.
     * Should now compile cleanly in Solaris.
     * Interape is a hardlinked to etherape. Runs as interape when called
       with that name.
     * Minor changes to the naming algorithm.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.8 (Wednesday 03-01-2000):

     * First  version  of interape. Run as EtherApe -I. I guess I'll have
       to change the name to netape now. :-)
     * Added node and link timeouts controls.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.7 (Tuesday 02-29-2000):

     * Pcap  filtering  added.  Now  you  can use tcpdump style filtering
       (enclosed in quotes) with the -f option.
     * Added libm to autoconf.in for systems with a separate math lib.
     * First try at Debian packaging.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.6 (Monday 02-28-2000):

     * Refresh  period  spin, averaging time spin, and link width sliders
       now work. Time to get better than Quake frame rates! :-)
     * Node, link and text colours can be set from the command line.
     * The  rest  of  the  GUI  is  active,  so that it can answer itself
       people's  favourite  question.  :-) (Well, Control-Q does actually
       work!)
     * Automated  release  process so that I can keep bombarding you with
       releases.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.5 (Sunday 02-27-2000):

     * More  for readability: Click on a node and a pop-up window appears
       with all node data.
     * You  can  change the network interface to listen to in the command
       line.
     * Fixed a bug in the dotted quad ip number display
     * Compiles without warnings
     * Updated README

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.4 (Sunday 02-27-2000):

     * Now parses command line arguments:
       etherape options
       -n, --numeric don't convert addresses to names
       -r,  --with-dns-resolving  use  IP  name  resolving. Caution! Long
       timeouts!
       -d, --diagram-only don't display any node text identification
     * The  resolver  is  turned  off by default since it can potentially
       freeze your display for too long
     * digram-only  makes  for  a  clearer  display.  It's intended to be
       practical whenever I have per-node pop-up windows ready.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.3 (Saturday 02-26-2000):

     * Links  with  no  traffic  disappear  with time. Makes diagram more
       readable.
     * IP host name displayed if no ether name available
     * Oops! Was confusing ether dst and src addresses. Solved.
     * Web page now has a much more interesting screenshot thanks to Nico
       Lumma
     * Buttons are in English now.
     * (This  file  I  had  to  get  out from download because it had the
       dangerous  DNS  behaviour by default. You see? That's what happens
       when you are rushed by deadlines! :-) )

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.2 (Saturday 02-26-2000):

     * James Wallace provided code to automatically detect proper network
       interface. It now compiles in NetBSD.
     * IP  number  displayed if no /etc/ethers is available. IP host name
       will be there in the Saturday Night edition. :-)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.1 (Friday 02-25-2000):

     * First look at GUI side of things
     * Now you can dynamically reset the node radius using a slider
     * First users reports! Thanks R., Don!
     * First improvements due to user feedback:
          + Solved configuration problem for some people
          + Improved web page and README: reference to /etc/ethers

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.0 (Friday 02-25-2000):

     * Diagram resizes with window
     * Basic  functionality  is  all  there  now,  and  calls for a minor
       version upgrade. :-)

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.0.8 (Thursday 02-24-2000):

     * Correctly  (I hope) calculates average traffic intensity for nodes
       and links. The proper constant multiplier should be user defined.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.0.7 (Thursday 02-24-2000):

     * First version showing links among nodes
     * Aborts gracefully if run by non-root.
     * http://etherape.sourceforge.net has a screenshot.
     * Expect proper node size and link width calculation in 0.0.8

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.0.6 (Wednesday 02-23-2000):

     * Copied   proper  libpcap  autoconfigure  detection  function  from
       ethereal

     * Node size is now an average of the last ten seconds traffic.
     * Proper distribution file.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.0.3 (Sunday 02-20-2000):

     * Added gnome support.
     * Substituted hash table for binary tree to store nodes
     * Correctly display hardware addresses.

  Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.0.2 (Saturday 02-19-2000):

     * Displays  circles  representing nodes and text which will identify
       it eventually.

  Overview of EtherApe 0.0.1 (Friday 02-18-2000):

     * Initial version. Don't even expect it to run.
